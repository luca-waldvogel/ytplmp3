# üéµ JiffyMP3 ‚Äì YouTube Playlist & Video to MP3 Converter

A simple **Flask-based web application** that converts entire **YouTube playlists or single videos** into MP3 files.
I built this tool so I can easily download tracks and **burn them onto CDs for my car** üöóüíø.

## ‚ú® Features
- Convert a **single YouTube video** to an MP3 file
- Convert a **YouTube playlist** to a ZIP archive containing all MP3s
- Clean file naming (playlist index + title for playlists)
- Web UI with **Bootstrap** and a loading spinner
- Helpful error messages and basic input validation
- **Privacy-friendly**: no user data is stored on the server

- **yt-dlp** for media extraction
